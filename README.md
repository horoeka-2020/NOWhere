Week 6 - Group Project Repo

# Group Members
1. Kittisan

4. Maria

# Aim
We want to build a photo gallery using react and redux. We also want to be creative with the display and functionality.

# MVP
1. As a user, I want to see a display of polaroids that represent locations (this is our Home page).

2. As a user, I want to be able to click on a location, which will take me to the specific location page (e.g. the HKG polaroid directs us to the Hong Kong page).

3. Each location page will display a list images with the image name and description.

# Stretch
- Welcome Page (Suitcase): This will be a CSS transition into our Home page. It should look like a suitcase opening up.
- Carousel for the Locations page. Will be using bootstrap. Will need a close button which redirects back to Home page.
